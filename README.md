# TACT App 

## Description

An online colloboration tool for corporate, educational, or any other organized group to come together and for the purpose of generating a "team personality" profile. This personality profile will be built via group members completing and competing in fun and familiar activities. Our beta test activity will be a digital version of the classic "Two Truths and a Lie" game. Users will login to the application through the sign-in method of their choice (Google, Facebook, Twitter), join their specific group, and then complete the tasks assigned to them by their group admin. Upon completion (or expiry) of all tasks, the admin will be provided with a result set outlining the team's profile, and provided with a ranked list of best team building venues via the Yelp API.
